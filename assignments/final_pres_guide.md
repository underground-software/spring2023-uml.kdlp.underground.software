##### Overview 

This is your opportunity to reflect on what you've learned in the course
and give feedback.

In your presentation you should demonstrate
your understanding of your work,
be able to explain what you did and why it matters to others,
and show your thought process when you are faced with a problem.

##### Duration

- Total hard time limit: 20 minutes

  - Main content duration: 10-12 minutes

  - Live coding and Q&A: 8-10 minutes

##### Guiding questions

- In your own words, what did you learn in this class?

- What assignments did you particularly enjoy or not enjoy? Why?

- What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- Are there any assignments you think you did an exceptional job on?

- How does your work in this class fit into the big picture?

##### Requirements

- Answer the guiding questions

- Make an initial submission for Fin2 by midnight the night before your presentation

  - During your presentation you must present this exact version of Fin2 as submitted

  - Like other initial submissions, you will only be graded on the subsequent final submission (due midnight 1 May 2023)


- You must have some visual support for your talking points

  - This can be a slide deck or something more creative

- You must demonstrate your work on Fin2:

  - Show your code

  - Show compilation

  - Show module load

  - Show the tests passing

  - Show an example usage of your driver

  - Show module unload

- If any of the above are incomplete, discuss what you tried and what you are planning to do next

- We will give you a small coding challenge based on Fin2 to complete live during your presentation

##### Recommendations

- Refer back to your assignment write ups

- When in doubt, explain your thought process clearly and in your own words
