[Lecture Recording](https://youtu.be/gtBNVjaN8bo)

Class Notes:

* Emphasize A1 & A2: get started ASAP.
  * Explained the assignments more with some examples.
* De-weighing of A0 and emphasis on following submission guidelines. This is a one time exception.
* For A2:
  * You can clone the kernel tree using the `--depth=1` option to make it quicker, but you will need to unshallow the tree for A4.
* Forgot to mention:
  * UML students: Sign up on LFX! Maybe wait till add/drop date passes.
